## Description

Welcome to my Core Java Concepts and Data Structures repository! This repository is a collection of Java implementations for fundamental Core Java concepts and classic Data Structures. As a passionate Java developer and an avid learner, I've found that understanding these concepts is crucial for building robust and efficient software solutions.

Throughout my journey, I've spent time studying Core Java concepts and Data Structures to deepen my understanding of the language and improve my problem-solving skills. This repository serves as a resource for myself and others to review and reinforce these essential topics.

## Contents

The repository is organized into two main sections:

### 1. Core Java Concepts

In this section, you will find Java code examples illustrating fundamental concepts and features of the Java programming language. Topics covered include:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Java Collections Framework
- Exception Handling
- Multithreading
- File I/O
- And more!

### 2. Data Structures in Java

This section contains Java implementations of classic Data Structures. Each Data Structure is accompanied by a clear explanation of its usage, time complexity analysis, and common operations. Data Structures covered include:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables (HashMaps)
- And more!

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository and dive into the code examples. Whether you are a Java beginner or an experienced developer, you can use this repository to:

- Refresh your knowledge of Core Java concepts
- Explore and understand common Data Structures and their implementations in Java
- Use the code examples as a reference for your projects
- Practice coding exercises to strengthen your problem-solving skills

## Contributions

I believe in the power of open-source collaboration and continuous improvement. If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvement, or want to contribute additional code examples, you are welcome to create pull requests. Together, we can create a valuable resource for the Java developer community.
